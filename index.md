## Professional Experience

### Postgraduate Researcher – Machine Learning & Data Science  
**National Buried Infrastructure Facility, University of Birmingham, UK**  
*May 2022 – Present*

- Identified research gaps caused by siloed modelling of pavements, subgrade soils, and buried pipelines.
- Designed a **physics-guided, diagnostic-first, prediction-second ML framework** balancing accuracy with engineering interpretability.
- Built an **end-to-end data pipeline** covering literature ingestion, parameter curation, synthetic data generation, modelling, and explainability.
- Generated **large-scale, evidence-based synthetic datasets** using SDV and literature-constrained Monte Carlo simulation.
- Developed **imbalance-aware ML models** (Random Forest, XGBoost) prioritising failure detection and safety-critical decision support.
- Applied **SHAP-based explainability**, subsystem ablation, and sensitivity analysis to validate physically consistent model behaviour.

**Impact:**  
Delivered a first-of-its-kind **system-level predictive decision-support framework** enabling earlier failure forecasting and coordinated preventative maintenance planning.
