# Research

## PhD: Machine Learning & Data Science for Infrastructure Monitoring (University of Birmingham)
I develop interpretable, end-to-end ML pipelines for **coupled buried infrastructure systems (pavement–soil–pipeline)** under **data-scarce conditions**.

### What I built
- End-to-end pipeline: literature ingestion → parameter curation → synthetic data generation → modelling → explainability
- Evidence-based synthetic datasets using **SDV** and literature-constrained **Monte Carlo** simulation
- Imbalance-aware predictive modelling with **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**
- Explainability and validation using **SHAP**, sensitivity analysis, and subsystem ablation

### Impact
Enables earlier failure forecasting and coordinated, system-level preventative maintenance planning—shifting decision-making from reactive repairs to risk-informed planning.
