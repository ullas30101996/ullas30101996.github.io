# Research

## PhD: Machine Learning & Data Science for Infrastructure Monitoring  
**University of Birmingham**

I develop interpretable, end-to-end machine learning pipelines for **coupled buried infrastructure systems (pavement–soil–pipeline)** under **data-scarce and class-imbalanced conditions**, with an emphasis on physical consistency and decision support for infrastructure management.

### What I built
- End-to-end ML pipeline covering:
  literature ingestion → parameter curation → synthetic data generation → modelling → explainability
- Evidence-based synthetic dataset generation using:
  - Literature-constrained **Monte Carlo simulation**
  - **Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)** to preserve cross-parameter dependencies
- Imbalance-aware predictive modelling using:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
- Model validation and interpretability using:
  - **SHAP** explainability
  - Sensitivity analysis
  - Subsystem ablation to verify system-level dependence

### Impact
Enables **earlier and interpretable failure forecasting** and supports **system-level, risk-informed preventative maintenance planning**, shifting decision-making from reactive, single-asset repairs to coordinated interventions under uncertainty.

## Mini Project: Smart Water Irrigation System (IoT)  
**Undergraduate Final Year Project | VTU (2018)**

Designed and implemented an IoT-enabled smart irrigation and water distribution system aimed at reducing water wastage and improving monitoring in suburban and agricultural settings.

### What I built
- Integrated **soil moisture sensors** and leak detection with microcontrollers
- Implemented real-time monitoring and automated control logic
- Developed a **cloud-based dashboard** for data visualisation and system status
- Deployed the system using **ESP8266** and **Raspberry Pi** for edge and gateway control

### Impact
Enabled automated, data-driven water distribution and early leak detection, demonstrating the practical application of embedded sensing, real-time data acquisition, and decision-support systems in resource-constrained environments.
